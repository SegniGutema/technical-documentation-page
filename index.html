          MyWebApp is designed with a modular architecture that separates the
          frontend and backend components. The frontend is built with ReactJS
          and communicates with the backend using API requests. The backend is
          built with Node.js and uses a PostgreSQL database to store user data.
        </p>

          MyWebApp uses a RESTful API to communicate between the frontend and
          backend. The API has several endpoints that allow for document
          creation, editing, and management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the endpoints listed in the previous section, the API
          also provides endpoints for user authentication and authorization, as
          well as for uploading and downloading files.
        </p>
        <label for="API_Reference_list">The available endpoints include:</label>
        <ul id="API_Reference_list">
          <li>`/documents`: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</li>
          <li>`/users`: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</li>
